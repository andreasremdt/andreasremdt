## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andreas, a Frontend Engineer located in Germany, currently working as a freelancer at [Toptal](https://toptal.com). I love building things in React (and JavaScript in general).

Occasionally, you can find my articles on Medium or CSS-Tricks, where I try to write about interesting topics. After my workday finishes, I am primarily interested in learning new skills; thankfully, there's always something new in the front end world :-)

If you want to get in touch or just see what I have been up to on the internet, you might want to check out the below links. Cheers ðŸ‘‹
